# gentoo-install
This repo is not intended to be actively developed or maintained, i'm just hosting my personal gentoo installation guide and a few config files.
If you are going to use this anyways please consider changing install.txt and all the config files to your requirements.
Perhaps i'm going to create an executable version in form of a bash script but this repo will probably stay untouched until my next gentoo installation.
I will not be giving support, I just thought it would be nice to share this.
